\subsection*{3D game in Unity platform}
For the final work I have chosen the theme "3D Pacman" that was created on the unity platform. The aim of the game is to collect all the points before time runs out and the player must pay attention that the player does not collides with other objects. Unity allows us after making game that it can be played on almost all platforms.
For the game we need models to make the game visually more interesting. For models i used Blender tool and included created models in Unity.
